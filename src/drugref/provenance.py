"""The one place a run record is written (#16).

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. Six orchestrators hand-wrote the same four lines -- INSERT the
ingest_run row, do the work, UPDATE finished_at, commit -- and every one of them wrote
the row INSIDE the transaction that did the work. A crashed run therefore rolled its
own provenance away, so `finished_at IS NULL` ("started, never finished") asserted a
state that could never be observed. Fixing that in six places is six chances to fix it
in five, which is the same argument that collapsed the per-source clear, the MeSH
reader and the checksum into one place each (#40, #43).

THE ASYMMETRY BETWEEN THE TWO FUNCTIONS IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Read them together:
open_run commits, finish_run does not, and neither is free to change.

# The writers db/025's CHECK admits, restated in Python because a value has to be
# spelled in both places to be usable. They are a PAIR: extend this tuple and the
# CHECK together, exactly as db/020's source trio must be extended together. A value
# in one and not the other is either refused at write time (Python-only) or invisible
# to callers (database-only).
#
# `curation` is not an orchestrator: it covers a DRUGREF-sourced run opened by a
# curator writing to Plan C's overlay tier. `unattributed` is historical only -- rows
# written before db/025, when two orchestrators shared a source and nothing told them
# apart -- and no code should ever write it.

    THE COMMIT IS THE FEATURE, not an implementation detail: the row has to outlive
    the rollback of the work it describes, or a crashed ingest leaves no trace at all.
    After this returns, the caller is in a FRESH transaction and everything it does
    from here is the work -- which rolls back on failure, leaving this row standing
    with finished_at NULL and ingest_run_incomplete able to report it.

    TRANSACTION OWNERSHIP, and the contract this tightens: an orchestrator now takes
    TWO transactions on one connection. A caller with pending work has it committed at
    this boundary. Callers were already required to commit their own work before
    calling an orchestrator, so this narrows an existing rule rather than adding one --
    but it is the sort of narrowing that is silent when broken, hence this paragraph.

    `writer` is required and keyword-only: it says WHICH orchestrator this is, as
    distinct from the authority `source` names. One source can have two writers
    (MED-RT does), so a release is only unambiguous per (source, writer).

    let `finished_at` become true about work that is subsequently rolled back: a
    consumer reading loaded_release would be told a release had landed while the
    projection still held the previous one. That is the exact failure open_run's early
