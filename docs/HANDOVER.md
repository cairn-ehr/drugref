# HANDOVER — drugref

> **The volatile half: where we are right now.** Regenerated at the end of every working session
> (nextsession rule 9) and kept **under 130 lines**, so a rewrite costs nothing.
>
> **THIS LINE IS THE ONLY HOME FOR THAT NUMBER.** Do not restate it in `CLAUDE.md`, a skill, or elsewhere.
> A bound is a vocabulary like any other, and this repo has repeatedly lost rounds to one rule kept in two
> places.
>
> **The stable half is [`PROJECT-NOTES.md`](PROJECT-NOTES.md)** — traps, state by layer, commands, schema and
> code map. Edited in place, under no bound. Slice sequencing is [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md); canonical what/why
> is in the immutable specs under [`superpowers/specs/`](superpowers/specs/).

## ⇒ NEXT

**Branch `claude/measured-floor` off `main`; PR OPEN against issue
[#182](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/drugref/issues/182). THE SCHEMA NOW ENDS AT `db/056`.** PR #183 (#179, the
tools channel) is MERGED. The suite total lives in PROJECT-NOTES § "How to run / test" and **nowhere else**, and
a test enforces that — `uv run pytest` fails if the line and the collected suite disagree.

**⇒ JUST FINISHED — THE MEASURED-FLOOR ROUND, CLOSING [#182](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/drugref/issues/182)**
(full account: PROJECT-NOTES § "The measured-floor round").

**⇒ WHAT SHIPPED.** `db/055` + `db/056` put a trigger floor under `ingest_run.duration_measured`, which `db/054`
protected with prose only: no INSERT may set it; a written `finished_at` never returns to NULL; `false → true`
only in the UPDATE writing the row's first `finished_at` (that is `provenance.finish_run`); once true, the flag
and both stamps are frozen. The migrations state what they do not stop (a hand-forged `finish_run` on a run that
is really open; a table owner's `DISABLE TRIGGER`).

**⇒ THE REVIEW ROUND.** Three agent reviewers on PR #184 found `db/055` still let a backfill through in two
statements (reopen `finished_at` to NULL, then pose as `finish_run`). `db/056` closes it; it is a new file
because `db/055` was already in the test DB's ledger, so `db/055`'s own header is true only with `db/056` applied.

**⇒ VERIFIED.** `tests/test_ingest_run_measured_floor.py` shows every rule refusing, each matched on its own
message, plus `finish_run` and an ordinary write to a measured row passing. `uv run pytest` green;
`ruff check .` clean.

## ⇒ DO THIS NEXT

**Choose one; none is blocked.**

1. **#163–#166**, **#168–#171** — the small filed follow-ups.
2. **[#177](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/drugref/issues/177) — seven modules over rule 4's cap**, `questions.py`
   at **797** down to `ingest/spl_match.py` at **524**, each a small self-contained round. Precedent is three
   deep (`spl_release.py`, `cli_status.py`, `registry_read.py`); the rule is always the same — find the SEAM,
   verbatim move, suite green, *then* behaviour. The ledger ratchets, so none of them may grow.
3. **`5c.5` pregnancy & lactation is spiked-not-designed** — LactMed puts 1,679 moieties outside MED-RT's thin
   lactation floor, gated on a **clinician review that has not happened** (23-row worklist).
4. **The class half of 5c.3** (#155, #102, word order); deferring it **RAISED** drug × drug yield by 193 pairs.

## Parallel project sequencing

DrugCentral is done: a **candidate-tier floor pinned to the 2023 release** — no refresh, no auto-alert. **SPL is a
fourth candidate source and DELIBERATELY NOT an arm of `exact_ddi_pair`**: it means *a label's interactions section
names both drugs*, not *an authority asserts they interact*. FDA toxicity is cleared; class-grain content (#98) gates
#112/#105.

## Open follow-ups

The full ledger lives once in [PROJECT-NOTES § "The standing open-issue ledger"](PROJECT-NOTES.md). **#179 is CLOSED
(PR #183); #182 closes with this PR.** Open: **#177** (seven over the cap), **#163–#166**, **#168–#171**. Standing: **#155** and **#102 re-opened**, both inherited by the deferred class
half; **#67** (salt↔base) is wanted by three sources and blocks a grain; **#158** untouched. Also #148, #149,
#151–#153, #128/#129, #132–#135, #124, #121/#123, #104, #94. Before production: re-run every parser on current
releases, resolve #17, the three rule-6 deeds (#6, #25, GSRS).

## Current DSN

- Test-only DSN: `host=localhost port=5532 dbname=drugref_test user=postgres`. Set `DRUGREF_TEST_DSN` for DB
  tests; never for reviewer accounts or GUI data — pytest recreates it. **See #153 before running two sessions
  at once: concurrent runs drop the schema under each other and the failures look real.**
- **`drugref176` is the watershed round's (#176)** — from nothing, migrated to `db/054`, a real `ingest unii` and a hand-built
  **old-client** row (the issue's `pg_sleep(2)`, recorded as 666 µs): the `0.0s` → `unmeasured` correction
  beside a measured row. **db/054 was edited in #181's review, so `drugref176` carries the OLD checksum and
  REFUSES to migrate — rebuild it from nothing if needed.** `drugref_test` is recreated by pytest (green here).
- **`drugref_notice174` is the SPL/role-split one** — chain + SPL as owner, then the same SPL ingest under role
  `drugref_app` (no ownership) twice, the second with `MAINTAIN`. **It still carries `drugref_app` and its
  GRANTs**, so it is the one database where the role split can be re-run (that round's record §1);
  **`options='-c role=…'` in a DSN runs an ingest AS another role** with no authentication story.
  `drugref_dur159`/`drugref_dur159mixed` are #159's, `drugref_spl160fix` (2 min 09 s) + `drugref_spl160`
  (12 min 51 s) show #160's 630 s, `drugref_spl051`/`drugref_spl` are #159's and the pre-`db/051` base,
  `drugref_dc049`/`drugref_dc101` DrugCentral's. **All of them predate `db/054` (and `db/055`/`db/056`, which add only triggers), so every runtime they show now
  reads `unmeasured` until re-ingested — intended, not a regression.**
  **Never patch one — rebuild under a new name**; editing an APPLIED migration breaks every database carrying
  it (`apply_migrations` is checksum-immutable).
- Corpora: `downloads/OPENFDA/` (14 partitions, 2026-08-22), `downloads/DAILYMED/` (6 Human Rx parts,
  2026-08-21, 17.6 GB). **`downloads/` is gitignored, so every SHA-256 is in the mining record §2** — verify
  against that table, not a manifest that vanishes with the bytes.
